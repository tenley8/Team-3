# Team-3 COVID-19 Analysis - ML Model for Ontario Cases

## Overview
Using TensorFlow Library, we are aiming to create a Neural Network Binary Classification Model that can predict the recovery (or fatality) of the patient depending on the age, the gender and the health region of Ontario, Canada.

#### Resources
- **Software:** JupyterLab, pgAdmin 4
- **Languages:** Python, PostgreSQL
- **Data Source:** [Ontario.csv](Resources\Ontario.csv) (Ontario Dataset)

## Results
The ML Model was able to predict with accuracy of 92%.

Please note that this is a mockup model without any tuning of the model as we are still at segment 1 of the project. (e.g. epoch selected was 10, which is really low)
More in-depth analysis and tuning will be made in the following segments.
