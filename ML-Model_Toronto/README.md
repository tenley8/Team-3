# ML Model for Toronto Cases

## Overview
Using TensorFlow Library, we are aiming to create a Neural Network Binary Classification Model that can predict the recovery (or fatality) of the patient depending on the age, the gender and the health region of Toronto, Canada.

#### Resources
- **Software:** JupyterLab, pgAdmin 4
- **Languages:** Python, PostgreSQL

## Initial Analysis
The table 1 describes the number of active, resolved and fatal cases and their percentage by age group.

The table 2 describes the number of active, resolved and fatal cases and their percentage by gender.

The table 3 shows top 10 and bottom 10 areas of Toronto by the fatality rate.
