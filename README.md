## Team-3 Project Overview  
For this project we are going to run an analysis to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 based on an individual's life style which includes an analysis of a persons' character traits. We created a dashboard to organize the COVID-19 data which is stored as csv data. Criteria for our analysis is based, but not limited to the following:
