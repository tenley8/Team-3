# Covid-19 Analysis Project

## Project Overview

Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an ongoing pandemic and as of July 2020, more than 11 million cases and 500k deaths have been reported across the world. Better understanding of how the virus spread and how we can reduce a risk of fatality is crucial to reduce the pressure on our health care system and better prepare ourselves for the next outbreak of new viruses.

This project aims to create the machine learning models which is capable of predicting the growth of Covid-19 cases and also the probability of fatality due to Covid-19, depending on the geographic, an individual's life style including the persons' character traits.

## Criteria for our analysis is based, but not limited to the following:

Age: Which age group has the highest risk of dying from COVID-19

Gender: From data provided, which gender is at risk of contracting COVID-19

Country: From the data provided, which country has the highest rate of COVID-19 infections

Income: Do lower income communities have higher risk of contracting COVID-19?

Health: Do people with pre-existing conditions have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19
