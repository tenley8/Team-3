## Background

The topic we choose for group project is Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Covid-19 first spotted in China, Wuhan and it spreads out gobally within 2-3 months 
and as for today, July 2020, there are more than 11 million cases and 500k deaths, which have been reported across the world and the numbers of cases would be continues
increased. As for now, a lot of countires have been investing heavying on researching the vaccines; however, the testing stage for the vaccines has not yet be successful.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to allow us to have better understandings of how the virus spread in the world and also, we would use a specific region (Ontario, Canada)
as an example to analyze wheather there are any correlations betwen Convid -19 and genders, desity of the area, age group and how we can reduce a risk of fatality and
maybe able to reduce the pressure on our health care system and better prepare ourselves for the next outbreak of the new viruses.
This project aims to create the machine learning models which is capable of predicting the growth of Covid-19 cases and also the probability of fatality 
due to Covid-19, depending on the geographic, an individual's life style including the persons' character traits.

## Analysis

Criteria for our analysis is based, but not limited to the following:
- Age: Which age group has the highest risk of dying from COVID-19
- Gender: From data provided, which gender is at risk of contracting COVID-19
- Country: From the data provided, which country has the highest rate of COVID-19 infections
- Income: Do lower income communities have higher risk of contracting COVID-19?
- Health: Do people with pre-existing conditions have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19
- Lifestyle: Does a person lifestyle choices indicates the probability of catching, and dying of COVID-19?
             - This can also include an individual's weight, behaviour, and proper nutrution.
