## Team-3 Project Overview  
For this project we are going to run an analysis to determine the probability of dying from COVID-19 based on an individual's life style which includes an analysis of a persons' character traits. We created a dashboard to organize the COVID-19 data which is stored as csv data. Criteria for our analysis is based, but not limited to the following:
 - Age: Which age group has the highest risk of dying from COVID-19
- Gender: From data provided, which gender is at risk of contracting COVID-19
- Country: From the data provided, which country has the highest rate of COVID-19 infections
- Income: Do lower income communities have higher risk of contracting COVID-19?
- Health: Do people with pre-existing conditions have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19
- Lifestyle: Does a person lifestyle choices indicates the probability of catching, and dying of COVID-19?
             - This can also include an individual's weight, behaviour, and proper nutrution.

 ## Objectives 
- Decide on a topic for the project: COVID-19
- Find the Data Source: Kaggle, WHO
- Analysis: What is the likelihood of dying from Covid-19
- Create GitHub Repository: [github Team-3](https://github.com/tenley8/Team-3)
- Create One Branch for each member: Dashboard, Database, Model, Presentation and Technology
- Create README.md
- Team-3 Roles: 
- Square: Create a repository and establish individual branches for each team member - Joyce, Tenley & Momar
- X: Decide which Technologies and Dashboard will be used. Momor and Tenley
- Triangle: Create a mockup of a machine learning model - Mohamed
- Circle: Create a mockup of a database - Taishi

## Summary 
Follow new cases found each day and the total number of cases and deaths in the US. The county-level tracker makes it easy to follow COVID-19 cases on a granular level, as does the ability to break down infections per 100,000 people.
